# Pari - Your Local AI Coding Companion

Pari is a desktop application designed to be your local AI-powered coding partner. It leverages the power of local Large Language Models (LLMs) through Ollama to assist you with various coding tasks, right on your machine.

## Purpose

The primary goal of Pari is to provide a seamless and efficient way to use LLMs for:

*   **Code Review:** Get feedback and suggestions on your code.
*   **Refactoring:** Improve the structure and quality of your code.
*   **Documentation:** Generate comments and documentation for your code.
*   **Code Generation:** Get help with writing new code snippets.

Pari is not intended to replace a full-featured IDE or powerful cloud-based AI services. Instead, it aims to be a trusted, local utility that can assist with coding tasks in an offline-first environment, ensuring your code remains private and secure.

## Current Status

Pari is currently in the **early development phase**. The foundational features are in place:

*   **Basic UI:** A user interface built with QML, featuring a file system browser, a code editor, and panes for AI interaction.
*   **File System Integration:** You can browse your local file system and open files in the editor.
*   **LLM Integration:** Pari can communicate with a local Ollama instance to send prompts and receive responses.
*   **Core Functionality:** The application can send the content of the code editor to the LLM and display the generated output.

The project is a hobby project (with Gemini) and somewhat actively being developed.
